## Box Content

* A AllRoad appliance
* A power rope \(or an external power supply depending on the model, e.g., . [Technical Specifications](https://docs.yoobackup.fr/~/edit/drafts/-LWjtVvwDwbXk_mJzQSr/v/english/specifications-techniques)\)
* A cable RJ45
* The base kit \(tray, fasteners, barrels and keys\)
* An inverter and a specific USB cable
* OneKey Restore USB key

## Anti-Tear Base

The installation of the anti-tear base is an additional security for your data protection. However, if you do not want to use it, you can go directly to the next step.

1. Choose a **flate**, **clean** and **non greasy** surface on a non peelable material \(to avoid: carpet, parquet, linoleum, furniture, etc...\). 
2. Position the base on the AllRoad \(**WARNING**: we recommend to position the box on the flank and not upside down to avoid crushing the system part of the case\). 
3. Hold the base in place with the fastener, slide in the two locks and lock with the provided keys.

4. Remove the protective film

5. Put the box at the desire location \(**WARNING**: make sure it is the definitive location, because you won't be able to move the box anymore\). The chimical adhesive will be fully active after 48h.

## Electrical Connection

We can now proceed to the electrical connection of the solution:

1. Connect the box to the inverter \(provided with the box depending on the chosen offer\)
2. Connect the inverter USB cable to any USB port of the appliance
3. Connect the inverter to the customer's power grid

## Network Connection

Each appliance has two network ports that can be used to associate it to two physical networks present in the installation.

The default port is indicated by a LAN sticker. If it is not the case, it is the port closest to the power port. 

Once the appliance physically connected to the customer's network, it must be accessible. For that, 3 solutions: 

1. If there is a DHCP and propagation of hostnames, the workstation will be available on the "wooxo-desktop" hostname.
2. You can use WTool which is an utility created by Wooxo \([downloadable here](https://www.wooxo.fr/WTool)\), pay attention if multiple appliances are connected. 
3. Directely from the appliance using a keyboard/screen and a maintenance account \(ID: config/password: config\).
