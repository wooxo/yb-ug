# YooBackup Activation

Now that the backup box is physically installed, we can configure the Yoobackup interface. To do this, follow the steps below.

## Step 1 - Network Configuration Validation

If it is the first time you log into the Yoobackup Web interface, you must validate the network configuration previously entered.

1. Go to http://\<IP\_of\_your\_yoobackup\_box>/host-settings and enter your administrator password (config, by default). __ See image below the step 7.
2. Select a hostname for the appliance (wooxo-desktop, by default).
3. Specify the IP parameters to use.
4. Validate the network configuration.
5. Go to http://\<IP\_of\_your\_yoobackup\_box_>._
6. Enter the license number provided by Wooxo. The solution license number is available on the delivery form associated with the appliance, in YooPortal or via Wooxo support.
7. Ensure that the ports 443 and 6670 are open at the output. Opening these ports prevents any malfunctioning box. For more details, see [Technical Prerequisites](https://docs.yoobackup.fr/installation/pre-requis-techniques-1).

## Step 2 - Choosing Super-Administrator credentials

You will be asked to validate the known information and to choose the super-administrator credentials that will then enable you to administer the solution.
