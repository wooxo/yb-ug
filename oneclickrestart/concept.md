# Concept

## Definition

The OneClickRestart allows creating a virtual machine directly on the appliance.

Once it is activated on a image or volume backup set or VMware, the system will consolidate a virtual machine ready to restart at any time directly on the appliance. 

## Limitations

Actually, the system is only compatible with volume images or VMware backup.

It is limited to one workstation for the AllRoad ranges and unlimited for the AllRoad premium and Backstone ranges.
